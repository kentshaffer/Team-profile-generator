## 10 Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator

Created a node.js driven dev team creator that turns inquirer inputs into dynamic HTML employee cards, displayed on an employee webpage. Unit tests have bee created and passed. User is able to add as many engineers or interns as desired and cards are generated for all. 

## Areas Covered:
* Node modules included in gitignore file so that the directory is not tracked or uploaded to GitHub.
* Dependencies installed to run inquirer.
* Variables created to plug inquirer responses into readme string template literal before the string literal is written into an HTML file.
* All unit tests pass.
* Screen recorded demonstration of app functions.

## Future Development:
* CSS styling for page layout.
* Eliminate the generation of duplicate employee cards when multiple employees of the same role are created.
